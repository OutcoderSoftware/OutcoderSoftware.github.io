                                    An industrial browser is a purpose-built solution designed specifically for warehouse and industrial environments to meet the needs of mobile workers. It provides secure browsing and allows organizations to configure the browser to address the unique requirements of their business and end-users. An industrial browser enables enterprise web applications to access hardware components such as barcode scanners, cameras, hardware buttons, and more. It ensures uniform page rendering across devices and operating systems, directs workflows linearly, and minimizes unnecessary interactions.

                                    Enterprise browsers have been gaining traction in recent years (early 2020s). The technology is being adopted by companies seeking controlled browsing environments in response to evolving cybersecurity threats and the shift to remote work. Industrial Browsers, on the other hand, have been around for a very long and are intended to be used by mobile workers in the supply chain industry, to improve productivity and reduce errors.

                                    Enterprise browsers are deployed either as standalone, enterprise-managed web browser solutions or as extensions integrated with existing browser applications. These browsers are designed with integrated security features, centralized policy management, visibility and reporting tools, as well as productivity and collaboration functionalities. Examples of enterprise browsers include Citrix Secure Browser, Island, and Prisma Access Browser. Industrial browsers, on the other hand, are deployed on mobile computers typically equipped with barcode scanners for data collection. These browsers are built to integrate seamlessly with the device's hardware components, such as barcode scanners and cameras. Examples of industrial browsers include Airlock Browser and Ivanti Velocity Browser.

In contrast, industrial browsers are optimized for specific workflows and integrations, making them more suitable for such environments. Additionally, industrial browsers offer deep integration with hardware components, such as barcode scanners, and provide expanded development capabilities beyond those of standard browsers. </div>
