Today we're pleased to announce that Airlock Browser for Android is now supported
on Panasonic devices. What this means is that you can harness the power
of Airlock Browsers client-side scripting to respond to various device events; in particular
barcode reader events.

To enable the barcode reader to work with Airlock Browser on Android Panasonic devices, launch the *UserButtonManager* app 
and assign the left and right buttons to the scanner.
 
Once this has been completed and you have exited the Barcode Reader app, 
you can launch Airlock Browser on your Panasonic device and begin scanning.

Thanks go out to our friends over at Panasonic, in particular Steven Sikorski and Sylvaine Smith,
who supported us during development.
