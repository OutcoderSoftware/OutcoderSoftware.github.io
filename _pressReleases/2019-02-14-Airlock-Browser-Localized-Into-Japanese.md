ZURICH SWITZERLAND --- February 14, 2019 --- Outcoder, the company that focusses on industrial and consumer web browsers, 
today announced that its industrial web browser, Airlock Browser, has been localized into Japanese, potentially attracting new customers 
within the Japanese market.

The localization of Airlock Browser was sponsored by CipherLab, a partner of Outcoder, and a world leader in AIDC solutions.

"Outcoder is committed to providing local language support for Airlock Browser across the globe." said Daniel Vaughan, 
Co-Founder and president of Outcoder. 
"Thanks to our partnership with CipherLab and its sponsorship of this localization effort, 
we're excited to be adding Japanese to our list of 29 supported languages."

Japanese language support follows on the heels of last month's announcement of the Outcoder / CipherLab partnership, 
which now sees Airlock Browser pre-installed on CipherLab's range of mobile computers. 

Airlock Browser is available now from the Outcoder website.
