Today, we're pleased to announce the general availability of Airlock Browser for Android.

Airlock Browser is a modern, feature rich, highly configurable web browser that allows mobile workers to be more productive. It has been specifically designed for ruggedized devices and is based on the popular Surfy Browser for Windows 10 and Android. Airlock Browser includes all the features you'd expect in an industrial browser, such as hardware barcode reader support, client side JavaScript and CSS execution, URL rules, remote configuration, and lock-down support; as well as some distinctive features, such as passcode and fingerprint authentication, text to speech, and a completely configurable user interface; menu and toolbar buttons can be displayed or hidden depending on your organization's needs. 

Presently, Airlock Browser supports Android devices running Android 5.0 (Lollipop), with built-in hardware support for Honeywell and Zebra devices.

On that note, we'd like to thank our friends over at Honeywell and Zebra for providing test devices; in particular [Ralph Theile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-theile-894b0b45/) of [Honeywell](http://www.honeywell.com) and [Rafal Firlejczyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafal-firlejczyk-70a28a21/) of [Zebra](http://www.zebra.com).
