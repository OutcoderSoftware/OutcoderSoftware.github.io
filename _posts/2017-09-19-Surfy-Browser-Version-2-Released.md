Today, I'm pleased to announce the general availability of Surfy Browser 2.0.
This new version has been in development for months, and includes a bunch of new features; 
most notably complete customizability of all menus and toolbars in the main interface.
Don't like the back button in the toolbar? Remove it. Want a print button in the main menu? Add it. 
Mix and match as you see fit. After all, Surfy is your browser.

There are various new options on the settings screen, and we've made a bunch of performance and stability improvements too.

We hope you enjoy using this new version of Surfy Browser.

Happy browsing!
