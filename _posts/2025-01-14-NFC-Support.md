We're excited to announce a new feature in **Airlock Browser**: NFC tag reading support! With this update, web applications can seamlessly interact with NFC-enabled devices, unlocking a range of possibilities for innovative solutions in your organization.

## Why NFC Tag Reading?

NFC (Near Field Communication) is a technology that enables short-range communication between devices. With Airlock Browser's new NFC support, you can now create web applications that respond to NFC tags, enabling features like contactless access, inventory tracking, or personalized user interactions.

## Getting Started with NFC Tag Reading

Enabling NFC tag reading in Airlock Browser is straightforward. Follow these steps to activate this feature for your web application:

1. Navigate to the **Launchpad** in Airlock Browser.
2. Long-press on your web application's tile to open the **Application** screen.
3. Ensure the **NFC Receive** option is enabled.

Once enabled, your web application will receive NFC tag information, which can be handled directly in client-side JavaScript.

## How It Works

When an NFC-enabled device reads a tag, Airlock Browser captures the tag's information and delivers it to the web application via JavaScript. This makes it easy to integrate NFC functionality without needing additional hardware or complex configurations.

For developers, Airlock Browser provides a robust set of NFC-related types and events that can be leveraged in client-side JavaScript.
