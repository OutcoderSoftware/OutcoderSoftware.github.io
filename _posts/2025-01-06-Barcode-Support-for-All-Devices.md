published: true
---

We're thrilled to announce a powerful new feature in **[Airlock Browser](https://outcoder.com/Products/AirlockBrowser/)**: 
support for hardware barcode readers for any device with a hardware barcode reader! 

This update enables any device with barcode scanning capabilities 
to integrate seamlessly with Airlock Browser, enhancing flexibility and efficiency for your organization.

## Why It Matters

Previously, Airlock Browser only supported hardware barcode readers of a predefined list of manufacturers. 
With this new feature, you can now configure the browser to work with barcode scanners from virtually any device. 
Whether you're scanning inventory, processing transactions, or managing logistics, 
Airlock Browser is now more versatile than ever.

## Getting Started with Barcode Intent Support

To configure your hardware barcode scanner with Airlock Browser, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the **Settings** view in Airlock Browser.
2. Navigate to the **Device** section.
3. Customize the **Barcode Intent Settings** to suit your organization's requirements.

This flexibility ensures that your device's barcode settings align perfectly with the browser, even if it's not explicitly supported by default.
