title: Where Agentic AI Becomes Application Logic
published: true
---

We started Orpius with a vision to help organizations automate complex, multi-step operations using a centralized agentic system. And we built exactly that. We designed Orpius from the ground up as a distributed intelligence layer, centralized in orchestration, capable of coordinating complex workflows across humans, AI agents, tools, and systems, all straight out of the box. The solution is compelling mainly because of its architecture. Many of the hard problems that others still wrestle with in agentic frameworks have already been solved. And that's why we're not stopping there.
## A Platform for Developers
As we built our own application on top of this platform, we realized we had something too valuable to keep to ourselves. So now, we're opening up full access to the core of Orpius. Not just for operations teams, but for developers as well. With a new mission to make powerful agentic AI secure, fast and easy (with little or no engineering work) to embed into any application.

## Not a Workflow Automation Tool
Agentic AI is having its moment. Everyone's talking about it. Everyone's trying to build it. Many frameworks today focus on helping you design and deploy agents or prototype multi-agent workflows, often through low-code or drag-and-drop interfaces.
Their core strength lies in workflow automation, step-by-step sequences, usually bound to a single session or use case.

We took a different path. We didn't just build another multi-agent framework. We built a  distributed AI system. And we've exposed it in a way that makes it immediately usable in your systems.
## Not Just Agents

We don’t just let you define agents, we give you a distributed orchestration layer where agents, tools, and systems collaborate intelligently. You’re not locked into single-session tasks or rigid flows.


## A Platform You Can Build On
We provide you with intelligent, distributed backend with endless possibilities for you to build on. You get built-in capabilities like event-driven tasks, scheduling, shared documents, secrets, vision, and even a .NET code engine.

You can use it to add intelligence to existing applications or to build entirely new ones. The main point is that you're free to focus on innovation and not system wiring.


Our platform doesn't tell you what to build, it gives you the freedom and capability to build anything. That's the most exciting part. Some developers are embedding Orpius into their SaaS products to offer next-gen customer experiences.
We're just getting started. And we can't wait to see what you build with it.
