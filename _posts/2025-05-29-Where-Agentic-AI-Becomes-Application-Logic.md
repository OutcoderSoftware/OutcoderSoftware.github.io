title: Where Agentic AI Becomes Application Logic

We started Orpius with a vision to help organizations automate complex, multi-step operations using a centralized agentic system. And we built exactly that. We designed Orpius from the ground up as a distributed intelligence layer, centralized in orchestration, capable of coordinating complex workflows across humans, AI agents, tools, and systems, all straight out of the box. The solution is compelling mainly because of its architecture. Many of the hard problems that others still wrestle with in agentic frameworks have already been solved. And that's why we're not stopping there.
