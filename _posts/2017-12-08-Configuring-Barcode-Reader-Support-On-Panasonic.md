To enable the barcode reader to work with Airlock Browser on Android Panasonic devices, launch the *UserButtonManager* app 
and assign the left and right buttons to the scanner.
 
Once this has been completed and you have exited the Barcode Reader app, 
you can launch Airlock Browser and begin scanning.
